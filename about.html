                    <div class="info">I'm 16 years old with a whole lot of passion and enthusiam in the tech industry. I love programming as well as creating websites and exciting pieces of software for everyone.</div>

                    <div class="info">&emsp;&emsp;I'm an 11th grader at Vo Thi Sau Highschool and it is 1 year away from me being a freshman at college.</div>
                    <div class="info">
                        Since the beginning of secondary school, I was not considered as an active nor excellent kid. School was tough back then, I was frustrated of receiving those complaints all the time. I knew I had to change.
                    </div>
                    <div class="info">
                        Things started getting better in my 9th grade, it was the first time that I was nominated as an excellent student after hundreds of hours of hard work. I knew that my ability was beyond what I thought. 
                    </div> 
                    <div class="info">
                        In 2023, I realized that there was nothing I wanted more than becoming a software engineer and being associated with the tech industry. I am working as hard as I can and I'm never gonna miss an opportunity.

                    <div class="title">English</div>
                    <div class="info">&emsp;&emsp;You know what? I'm a big fan of EngLish. I started studying this language since 7 years old and I've never lost my interest.
                         I just started tutoring IELTS students and i fell in love with the job.
                    </div>
                    <div class="info">
                        Thanks to that, I've had a chance to interact with new people as well as to share my experiences and mindset, thereby further understand myself.
                    </div>
                    <div class="info">The reason why I consider English a huge advantage is that it allow me to obtain international standardized sources of knowledge. Much of the world's scientific research, academic publications 
                        and technological innovations are available in English.

                        It took me 2 years of chess study to beat my dad at the game, from which point I kept on analizing chess games and developing my play. At the moment, I'm a chess candidate of Binh Thanh Districh with an Elo rating of
