                    <div class="info">At my 7th birthday, my father gave me a chess board as a present, he was the first person to ever taught me and inspire me to be a chess player. It took me 2 years of study 
                        to beat my dad at chess, from which point I kept on analizing chess games and developing my play. At the moment, my Elo rating (and offical rating for all chess players) is 
                        roughly 1800 and it is 500 points away from being a FIDE Master. Chess taught me a lot about patience, consistency, strategic thinking and self-control, which is great!
